# Oflix Project

This is a full Symfony project which is a Netflix/Allocine styled website. We can add TV Shows, with the Synopsis, Picture, Characters ( Actor's name, story of the character, age & other informations ), categories of the show, seasons etc... 
We can't see any show, that's more than a database.

## Different sections

  - Homepage with three last entries, Login or register
  - TV Show page where all shows are published
  - Page of the selected TV Show with all informations about it
  - A favorite page, where you can list your favorites shows
  - And for administrators, a backoffice section to manage the entire sections ( edit / delete / add )
